# regex

Pony library that brings Perl compatible regular expressions to Pony. Requires libpcre2. See installation for more details.

## Status

Production ready.

## Installation

* Install [corral](https://github.com/ponylang/corral)
* `corral add github.com/ponylang/regex.git`
* `corral fetch` to fetch your dependencies
* `use "regex"` to include this package
* `corral run -- ponyc` to compile your application

## Dependencies

`regex` requires the libpcre2 library in order to operate. You'll need to install it within your environment of choice, either via your package manager or from source.

### Installing on APT based Linux distributions

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpcre2-dev
```

### Installing on Alpine Linux

```bash
apk add --update pcre2-dev
```

### Installing on Arch Linux

```bash
pacman -S pcre2

```

### Installing on DragonFly

```bash
sudo pkg install pcre2
```

### Installing on FreeBSD

```bash
sudo pkg install pcre2
```

### Installing on macOS with Homebrew

```bash
brew update
brew install pcre2
```

#### Installing on macOS with MacPorts

```bash
sudo port install pcre2
```

### Installing on OpenBSD

```bash
doas pkg_add pcre2
```

### Installing on RPM based Linux distributions with dnf

```bash
sudo dnf install pcre2-devel
```

### Installing on RPM based Linux distributions with yum

```bash
sudo yum install pcre2-devel
```

### Installing on RPM based Linux distributions with zypper

```bash
sudo zypper install pcre2-devel
```

### Installing on Windows

If you use [Corral](https://github.com/ponylang/corral) to include this package as dependency of a project, Corral will download and build PCRE2 for you the first time you run `corral fetch`.  Otherwise, before using this package, you must run `.\make.ps1 libs` in its base directory to download and build PCRE2 for Windows. In both cases, you will need CMake (3.15 or higher) and 7Zip (`7z.exe`) in your `PATH`; and Visual Studio 2019 (or the Visual C++ Build Tools 2019) installed in your system.

### Building PCRE2 from source

```bash
wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
tar xvf pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
cd pcre2-10.21
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```
